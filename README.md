# Test framework for practice with Python and pytest using webdriver and robot frameworks
# This repository contains a test framework designed for practicing Python and pytest.
# It utilizes the WebDriver for browser automation and integrates with Robot Framework for additional testing capabilities.
# The framework is structured to allow easy addition of new tests and features, making it suitable for both beginners and experienced testers.
# The framework is organized into several directories:
# - `tests`: Contains the test cases written in Python using pytest.
# - `chromdriver`: Contains the WebDriver executable for Chrome.
# The framework utilizes logging to provide detailed output during test execution, which can be helpful for debugging and understanding test flow.
# Instructions for running pytest tests:
# 1. Ensure you have Python and pytest installed.
# 2. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
# 3. Run the tests using pytest by executing `pytest` in the terminal.
# 4. For more detailed output, you can run `pytest -v` or `pytest --tb=short`.
# # Instructions for running Robot Framework tests:
# 1. Ensure you have Robot Framework installed.
# 2. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
# 3. Run the tests using Robot Framework by executing `robot tests`.
# 4. For more detailed output, you can run `robot --loglevel DEBUG tests
